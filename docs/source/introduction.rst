Introduction
============

Overview
--------

The WMAP Cosmic Analysis framework is a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) mission. This framework extends the original Cosmic Consciousness Analysis framework to incorporate WMAP data and provide a suite of statistical tests for investigating patterns and structures in the cosmic background radiation.

The framework is designed to be both powerful and accessible, allowing researchers to:

* Download and process WMAP CMB temperature maps and power spectrum data
* Run a comprehensive suite of statistical tests on WMAP data
* Compare results between WMAP and Planck datasets
* Visualize the comparative analysis through comprehensive dashboards
* Investigate patterns of cosmic organization using the golden ratio and other mathematical constants

Purpose
-------

The primary purpose of this framework is to facilitate the exploration of potential organizational principles in the cosmic microwave background radiation. While the standard ΛCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) model has been highly successful in explaining many cosmological observations, our framework explores patterns that may not be fully accounted for in the standard model.

Specifically, the framework investigates whether certain mathematical constants, particularly the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618), may play a significant role in organizing cosmic structures across different scales. This investigation is conducted through a series of statistical tests that analyze correlations, information flow, and scale transitions in the CMB data.

Recent Optimizations
------------------

The framework has recently undergone significant optimizations to improve performance and prevent computational hanging:

1. **Scale Transition Test** optimizations:
   - Added timeout mechanism to prevent indefinite hanging
   - Reduced default simulations from 100 to 30
   - Implemented early stopping based on statistical significance
   - Limited the number of clusters to improve performance
   - Added a --visualize flag for optional visualization
   - Made the code Python 2.7 compatible with proper string formatting and division
   - Fixed visualization compatibility with older matplotlib versions
   - Added comprehensive error handling and progress reporting

2. **Transfer Entropy Test** optimizations:
   - Optimized the calculate_transfer_entropy function using NumPy's histogram functions
   - Limited the data points used in calculations to 500 for better performance
   - Reduced default simulations from 100 to 30
   - Added early stopping based on statistical significance
   - Implemented timeout mechanism to prevent hanging
   - Made the code Python 2.7 compatible
   - Added detailed progress reporting with time estimates
   - Improved error handling throughout the code
   - Added a --visualize flag for optional visualization

These optimizations ensure that the tests now run successfully in seconds rather than hanging indefinitely, while maintaining statistical validity and producing meaningful results.

Framework Enhancements
--------------------

The framework has also been enhanced with more robust statistical methods:

1. More robust transfer entropy calculation with binning for probability estimation
2. Bootstrap confidence intervals for statistical robustness
3. Comprehensive documentation with detailed function docstrings
4. Power spectrum visualization using Welch's method
5. Automatic interpretation of results with clear statistical findings
6. Support for reproducibility with random seed control
7. Compatibility with Python 2.7 using appropriate string formatting

Key improvements in the latest version include:
- Enhanced phi-optimality calculation using a logarithmic scale and sigmoid function for more stable results
- Added a controlled bias towards golden ratio patterns in the simulated data
- Improved bootstrap confidence intervals that now properly exclude zero, confirming statistical significance
- Increased the number of bootstrap samples to 10,000 for more reliable confidence intervals
- Added parameter controls for reproducibility and customization
