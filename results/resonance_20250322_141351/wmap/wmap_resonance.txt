Resonance Analysis Test Results: WMAP CMB Data
==================================================

Resonance Score: 0.000000
P-value: 1.000000
Phi-Optimality: 0.000000
Significant: False

Number of Resonance Peaks: 1
Mean Ratio Between Peaks: 0.000000
Standard Deviation of Ratios: 0.000000
Harmonic Pattern Detected: False

Peak Multipoles and Powers:
  Peak 1: â„“ = 231.0, Power = 2.250419

Interpretation:
  Weak resonance pattern: The CMB power spectrum shows limited harmonic organization.
  This suggests minimal wave-like organization in the cosmic microwave background.
