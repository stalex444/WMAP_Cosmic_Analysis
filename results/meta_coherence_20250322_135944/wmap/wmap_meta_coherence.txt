Meta-Coherence Test Results: WMAP CMB Data
==================================================

Meta-Coherence: 0.127112
P-value: 0.780000
Phi-Optimality: -0.373486
Significant: False

Interpretation:
  Low meta-coherence: The local coherence measures show little organization.
  This suggests the CMB power spectrum lacks multi-scale organization.
